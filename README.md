# Boilerplate React App

This is the result boilerplate project for react based on [this scotch.io tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/setup-a-react-environment-using-webpack-and-babel). Straight to the point, great for beginners or developers who want to start off with bare minimum environment to get a React project up and running.

This project is primarily for myself to quick-start with React projects, but perhaps it could prove useful for other developers too :)

All the information below this point (except for Recommended Tools) can be found in the tutorial linked above, but they are added here for quick reference.

## Minimum Project Contents:

- react
- react-dom
- webpack - used for splitting, transforming and bundling resource files.
- webpack-dev-server - for hot-loading webpage upon code updates
- babel - compiles ES6 and JSX into native Javascript code. Why? Because ES6 and JSX are not available in modern browsers (yet).
- html-webpack-plugin - injects script and stylesheet tags into the html.

## Requisites

- **NodeJS** - for hosting a server and using the NPM (Node Package Manager)
- **Yarn** - an enhanced version of npm

## Recommended Tools

- **Visual Studio Code** - Cross-platorm, lightweight IDE. Has great plugins that make development painless.
- **Sublime Text** - Cross-platform, lightweight IDE. UI is less appealing, but performance is faster than VS Code.
- **Cmder** - (Windows) Portable CLI. I use it solely for the coloured UI and multiple-tab feature.
